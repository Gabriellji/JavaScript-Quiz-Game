### Description

This is a few pages web app built to run a quiz, including characters, power skills, score tracking and storage in Local memory. It has been built with simple logic and pure only vanilla JS

It is for users to test their knowledge choosing from `true/false` options and then to receive a score at the end of the game.

Our group is made up of Roxanne, Jane, Nadine and Viet. We are a group of web developers from different parts of the world that have come together to build this project.

**We hope you enjoy our game as much as we enjoyed creating it together.**
